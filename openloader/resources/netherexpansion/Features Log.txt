Welcome to the Nether Expansions Features log
How this works is Each Feature is Split into Catagories of "Crimson Forest, Warped Forest, Soul Sand Valley, Basalt Delta, Gear n Items and Misc!

===CUSTOM ITEM TEXTURES GUIDE===

for CIT/Renamable Items There will be a Sub-Cataogry inside an Existing one, The First one Tells you what to Name it and the Second one Tells you what Item to Rename
For example if you want Magma Fungus simply name any in game Paper to "Magma Fungus" and place it in an Empty Item frame!

Tip: If you want to See the Item Frames use F3 + B to see it's Hitboxes if you can!

===CONNECTED OVERLAYS GUIDE===

Simply Place Two Different Blocks Which are Compatable with Each other like shown in the Catagories to Get a New Block!
For Example placing Nether Wart Blocks next to Blackstone Bricks you will get Crimson Mossy Blackstone!

Tip: if one of the Blocks have Slabs Use Those to Prevent Blocks from Connecting!
