A tamed drake, however, makes a remarkably good mount. Their horn and claw attacks are powerful, and I found it could carry my travelling trunk with very little trouble. Those who ride them into battle will often equip them with protective armor."

It will throw you off repeatedly, but so long as you get back on every time, it will eventually accept you. I've also found that once they've been tamed, Overworld Drakes tend to be quite fond of wheat."
