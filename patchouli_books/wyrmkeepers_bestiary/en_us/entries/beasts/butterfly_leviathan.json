However, the captain of the ship upon which I am travelling claims to have heard a tale of a man who has tamed one. Allegedly, he came across a beached Leviathan that had washed ashore during a rainstorm, and after being struck by lightning, was daft enough to feed it raw meat, rather than run for his life. I remain skeptical."
